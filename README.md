# Objective

This repository contains the practical material to use on PlasmaBio for the first (out of 7) session of my R lectures to the master students of the magistère européen de génétique at Université de Paris.
It contains tow folders:
- R0: with preparatory activities linked to my you tube videos on first steps in R
- R1: with a tutorial notebook on vectors, a practical notebook on vectors and a script corresponding to the tutorial notebook.
